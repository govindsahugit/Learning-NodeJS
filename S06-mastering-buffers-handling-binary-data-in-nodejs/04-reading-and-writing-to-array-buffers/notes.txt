Reading and writing a buffer
	
	for reading arrayBuffer content we need to create an another object.
	Dataview is a constructor function it require arrayBuffer as firt argument.
	It gives a bunch of methods for setting and getting the data in buffer.
	
	Ex: view.setInt8(1, 70)

	The setInt8 method takes index and the data to write as argument

	What is byteOffset ?
		It means how much byteControl the DataView has.
		It take second argument for byteOffset, bydefault it is 0.
	
	for reading data we use .getInt8(index) this reads as signed value
	
	.getUint8(index) this reads as Unsigned value.

Signed and Unsigned Binary Numbers
	
	Till now we have seen only positive numbers.
	
	8 Bit Signed = negative (-128 to +127)
	8 Bit Unsigned = Positive (0 to 255)

	Signed Bits is determined by starting bit of byte.
	If starting bit is 1. It will think it of as negative number.
	and take 2's Compliment of whole byte.

	Till the value of 127, it's 2's compliment will be same (Positive Only)
	Because it's starting digit is 0 not 1.

	This is important cuz when we will create our own buffer at that time we need to tell it whether it is signed or unsigned

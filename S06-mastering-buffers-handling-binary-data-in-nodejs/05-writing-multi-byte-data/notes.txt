Writing Multi Byte Data
		
	.setInt8() has limitation to 255 (8 Bits only)
	.setInt16() can store larger numbers (16 bits)

	we can also pass 3rd argument of Endian, by default it is LE
	(true for BE) Only comes with multi-byte (16 and 32)

	.getInt16(index, ?Endian)

	we also have methods for 64 Bits.

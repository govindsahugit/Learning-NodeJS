Array Buffers:
    Array of Bytes
    In Browser ArrayBuffer() is a constructor function.
    So it need to call with new keyword.

    It has some properties: 
        byteLength
        datached
        maxByteLength
        resizeable
    
    We can store maximum 1.99 GiB in it.

    # We cannot directly update the array buffer.
    # We use typedArray and Dataview for it.
    # ArrayBuffer are Garbage collected in JS.

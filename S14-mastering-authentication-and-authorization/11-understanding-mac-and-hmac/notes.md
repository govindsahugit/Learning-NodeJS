# MAC/HMAC Vs Digital Signature

## MAC (Message Authentication Code)

- A code to verify data integrity and authenticate the sender
- Uses a secret key combined with the message
- Both sender and receiver share the same secret key
- Anyone with the key can create and verify the MAC

## HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code)

- A type of MAC that uses a cryptographic hash function (e.g., SHA-256)
- More secure than just hashing the key and message directly
- Protects against certain attacks like length-extension

## Digital Signature

- Uses asymmetric cryptography (private/public key pair)
- The sender signs a message with their private key
- Anyone with the public key can verify the signature
- Provides authenticity and non-repudiation (proof the sender signed)

## Differences between MAC/HMAC and Digital Signature

- MAC/HMAC uses a shared secret key; digital signatures use a key pair
- MACs can be generated and verified by anyone with the key; signatures can only be generated by the private key holder
- Digital signatures allow public verification without revealing private keys
- MACs are mainly for ensuring integrity and authentication between trusted parties; digital signatures provide stronger guarantees including non-repudiation

# What is OAuth?

OAuth is a way for apps to access your data without needing your password.

For example, a new app can get your Google files without you giving it your Google password.

## How It Works

1. You (the user) want to use an app that needs your data (like Google Drive files)
2. The app sends you to Google's login page to ask for permission
3. You log in and allow the app to access only certain data (like files or emails)
4. Google gives the app a special key (called an access token)
5. The app uses that key to get your data – but only what you allowed

## Why OAuth is Good

✅ **Safe** – You don't have to share your password

✅ **You stay in control** – You choose what the app can see

✅ **You can stop access anytime** from your account

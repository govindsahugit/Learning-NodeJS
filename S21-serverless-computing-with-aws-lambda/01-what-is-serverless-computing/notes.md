# Serverless Computing with AWS Lambda

## 1. What is Computing

Computing means using a computer to do work such as storing data, processing data, running programs, or solving problems. When a computer takes input, processes it, and produces output, that is computing.

**Examples:**
- Calculating numbers in a calculator
- Running a website
- Saving files in a database
- Playing a video

## 2. What is Server-Based Computing

Server-based computing means running applications and services on servers that you manage or control. The server runs continuously, waiting for requests while you handle setup, maintenance, and security.

**Examples:**
- Hosting a website on a VPS
- Running a backend on EC2 or DigitalOcean
- Managing databases on your own server

**Key Points:**
- Server always remains on
- You manage setup, updates, and scaling
- You pay even when the server is idle

## 3. What is Serverless Computing

Serverless computing means running code without managing servers. The cloud provider handles servers, scaling, and maintenance automatically. Your code runs only when an event occurs.

**Examples:**
- API functions using AWS Lambda
- Image processing after upload

**Key Points:**
- No server management required
- Automatic scaling
- Pay only when code runs

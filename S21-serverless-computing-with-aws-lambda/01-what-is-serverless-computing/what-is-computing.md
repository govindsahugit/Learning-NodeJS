## 🧮 What Does “Computing” Mean?

**Computing** means performing calculations and logical operations on data to produce a result.

At the lowest level, everything a computer does is:

* mathematical operations
* logical decisions
* data movement

All of this happens internally using **binary operations (0s and 1s)**.
Because computers perform these computations continuously, the process itself is called *computing* and the machine itself is called *computer*.

## 💻 Computing and Programming Languages

When any programming language runs, it is performing computation under the hood.

Even though programming languages look high-level and abstract, internally:

* instructions are converted into low-level operations
* the CPU performs arithmetic and logic
* memory is read and written

So running a program is fundamentally **running computation**, regardless of the language used.

## ⚙️ What Does “Compute” Mean as a Quantity?

In day-to-day technical usage, the word **compute** is also used as a **measurable resource**.

When people say:

* “This task needs more compute”
* “This system uses very little compute”
* “We don’t have enough compute”

They are referring to the **amount of computational resources required**, mainly:

* CPU power
* execution time
* processing capacity

So:

* *More compute* means more processing power or more time spent computing
* *Less compute* means fewer calculations or lighter processing

Compute is simply **how much computation is being performed**.

## ☁️ What Is Cloud Computing?

**Cloud computing** means performing computation on **remote machines** instead of local ones.

The nature of computing does not change:

* computations still happen
* binary operations still occur
* CPU and memory are still used

What changes is:

* where the computation runs
* who owns and manages the machines

In cloud computing, you use computing power provided by cloud providers over the internet, instead of maintaining your own machines. We are also using cloud compute by hosting our storage app on EC2 instance.

## ✅ Simple Summary

* Computing means executing calculations and logic on data.
* All programs perform computation internally using binary operations.
* “Compute” is often used to describe how much processing power is required.
* Cloud computing is simply computing done on remote, managed machines.

## RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)

RBAC is a way to control what users can do in an application by assigning them roles (like Admin, Manager, User). Each role has specific permissions (like read, write, delete), and users get access based on their role.

### Key Points:

- Users are assigned Roles
- Roles have predefined Permissions
- It's easier to manage than giving individual permissions
- Improves security, scalability, and auditability

### Example:

- **User** → can read/write their own files
- **Manager** → can read all files
- **Admin** → full access to everything

### RBAC is commonly used in apps because it's simple, secure, and easy to manage

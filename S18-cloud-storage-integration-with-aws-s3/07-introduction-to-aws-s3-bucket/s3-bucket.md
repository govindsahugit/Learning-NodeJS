# What is AWS S3 Bucket?

An **S3 bucket** is a **storage container** provided by **Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)** — part of Amazon Web Services (AWS). It is used to **store and organize files (called objects)** in the cloud.

### 🔹 In Simple Terms:

* Think of a **bucket as a folder** in the cloud.
* You can **upload any type of file** to it (images, videos, documents, code, etc.).
* These files are stored as **objects**, each having a unique key (name).

# How Does Mobile Internet Work?

Mobile internet works through a series of steps that connect your phone to the wider world. Here’s a breakdown:

## 1. Phone Sends Signal
Your phone communicates with the nearest cell tower using radio waves.

## 2. Tower Picks Up the Signal 📡
The cell tower receives your phone’s signal, whether it’s for a call or internet access.

## 3. Tower Sends Signal to the Main Network 🧠
The tower forwards your signal to the main mobile network system.

- **For Calls:** The network locates the person you’re calling.
- **For Internet:** The network connects you to the website or app you requested.

## 4. Main Network or Internet Responds 🌍
The main system or the internet sends the response or data back to the tower.

## 5. Tower Sends Response to Your Phone 📱
The tower transmits the response back to your phone using radio waves.

## 6. Handover When You Move 🚗
If you move away from the current tower, your connection is seamlessly handed off to a new nearby tower so you don’t lose signal.

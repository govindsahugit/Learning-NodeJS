# History of the Internet

## 1960s – The Cold War & ARPANET
- The U.S. feared a nuclear attack could destroy communication lines.
- ARPANET was created in 1969 to connect four universities using packet switching.
- First message sent: "LOGIN", but only "LO" was received before a crash.

## 1970s – TCP/IP is Born
- Different networks couldn’t communicate with each other.
- Vint Cerf & Bob Kahn proposed TCP/IP in 1974, allowing all types of networks to connect.

## 1983 – The Internet is Born
- ARPANET adopted TCP/IP on January 1, 1983.
- This allowed multiple networks to become one big network — the Internet.

## 1986 – NSFNET & Academic Growth
- NSFNET connected more universities and research labs.
- The Internet started expanding globally.

## 1990s – Public & Commercial Use
- The Internet opened to the public and businesses.
- Services like email and file sharing became common.

## 2000s–Now – Rapid Growth
- High-speed internet, Wi-Fi, and smartphones became widespread.
- Billions of devices are now connected globally.

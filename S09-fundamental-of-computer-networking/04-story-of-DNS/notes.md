# History of DNS

## Before DNS – hosts.txt (1970s–1983)
- Early ARPANET used a file called `hosts.txt` to map names to IP addresses.
- Elizabeth Feinler and her team at SRI managed this file and helped define top-level domains like `.com`, `.edu`, and `.gov`.
- **Problem:** The file became too large and difficult to maintain as the network expanded.

## Invention of DNS – 1983
- Paul Mockapetris created the Domain Name System (DNS) to replace `hosts.txt`.
- DNS is distributed, hierarchical, and scalable.
- It allows automatic name-to-IP resolution using servers.

## Integration into Applications
- Tools like Telnet, FTP, and email began using domain names instead of IP addresses.
    - **Before:** `telnet 193.34.23.2`
    - **After:**  `telnet example.com`

## DNS Today
- Supports millions of domains, security features (like DNSSEC), and global scalability.
- Critical for websites, email, apps, IoT, and cloud services.

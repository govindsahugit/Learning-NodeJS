## TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)

- **Reliable and connection-oriented:** Ensures data is delivered in order and without errors.
- **Three-way handshake:** Establishes a connection before data transfer.
- **Acknowledgments and retransmission:** Confirms receipt of data and resends if necessary.
- **Use cases:** Web browsing (HTTP/HTTPS), email (SMTP), file transfers (FTP).
- **Analogy:** Like a phone call—both parties connect and confirm messages.

## UDP (User Datagram Protocol)

- **Fast and connectionless:** Sends data without establishing a connection.
- **No delivery guarantees:** Data may arrive out of order, be duplicated, or lost.
- **No setup or acknowledgments:** Minimal overhead, making it faster but less reliable.
- **Use cases:** Live video streaming, online gaming, voice calls (VoIP).
- **Analogy:** Like sending a postcard—quick, but no guarantee it arrives or in what order.

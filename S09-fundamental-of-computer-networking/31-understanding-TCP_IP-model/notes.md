## TCP/IP Model Overview

The TCP/IP model is a practical, four-layer framework that describes how data moves across the Internet. It is simpler and more widely used in real-world networking than the OSI model.

### TCP/IP Layers and Their Functions

**1. Network Access Layer**  
- Handles the physical transmission of data over network hardware (such as cables, Wi-Fi, and network cards).  
- Combines the functions of the OSI model’s Physical and Data Link layers.

**2. Internet Layer**  
- Manages addressing and routing of data between networks.  
- Corresponds to the OSI model’s Network layer.

**3. Transport Layer**  
- Ensures reliable and accurate delivery of data between devices.  
- Equivalent to the OSI model’s Transport layer.

**4. Application Layer**  
Combines OSI’s Application, Presentation, and Session layers.
Key Points:

TCP/IP is the real-world model behind the Internet.
It’s simpler than OSI and focuses on practical implementation.
OSI is mainly for learning concepts, while TCP/IP is what’s actually used.

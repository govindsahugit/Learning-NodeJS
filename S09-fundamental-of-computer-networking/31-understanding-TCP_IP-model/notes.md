## TCP/IP Model

The **TCP/IP model** is a four-layer networking framework that underpins the Internet. It is more practical and widely used than the OSI model, accurately representing how data moves through real networks.

### TCP/IP Layers and OSI Model Mapping

| TCP/IP Layer      | Corresponding OSI Layers                                 |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| 4. Application    | 7 (Application), 6 (Presentation), 5 (Session)          |
| 3. Transport      | 4 (Transport)                                           |
| 2. Internet       | 3 (Network)                                             |
| 1. Network Access | 2 (Data Link) + 1 (Physical)                            |

### TCP/IP Layers Explained

| Layer             | Function                                                                 |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 4. Application    | Provides services for user applications                                 |
| 3. Transport      | Ensures end-to-end communication, reliability, and flow control         |
| 2. Internet       | Handles addressing and routing of packets across networks               |
| 1. Network Access | Manages physical transmission and access to network media (hardware)    |

**Notes:**
- The TCP/IP model forms the basis of the Internet.
- It is simpler and more practical than the OSI model.
- The OSI model is mainly used for theoretical understanding, while TCP/IP is used in real-world networking.

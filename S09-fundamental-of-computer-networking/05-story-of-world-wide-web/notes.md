## Invention of the Web (1990)
- Tim developed:
    - The first web browser/editor: **WorldWideWeb**

    - The first web page: explained what the Web is
- He introduced:
    - **HTML** – for creating web pages
    - **HTTP** – the protocol for web communication
    - **URLs** – to locate resources

## The Web Goes Public (1991)
- CERN made the web publicly available.
- Anyone with Internet access could now create and access websites.

## Growth Explosion (Mid-1990s)
- **1993:** Mosaic, the first graphical web browser, launched—making the Web visual and popular.

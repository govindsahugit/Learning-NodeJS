## What is Network Topology?

Network topology refers to the physical or logical arrangement of devices (such as computers, printers, and servers) within a network and how they are interconnected.

### Types of Network Topologies

- **Point-to-Point:** A direct link between two devices.
- **Bus:** All devices are connected to a single central cable (the bus).
- **Ring:** Each device is connected to exactly two other devices, forming a closed loop.
- **Star:** All devices are individually connected to a central hub or switch.
- **Mesh:** Every device is connected directly to every other device in the network.
- **Tree:** A hierarchical combination of star and bus topologies, with groups of star-configured networks connected to a linear bus backbone.
- **Hybrid:** A combination of two or more different topology types to form a more complex network structure.

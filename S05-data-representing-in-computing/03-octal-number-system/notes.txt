Octal Number System
	In Octal number system is the combinations of (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7)
	These are eight digits that's why it is called as octal number system.
	 
	In ES6, We cannot direct write the octal numbers since it's deprecated.
	Instead we can use the modern syntax of 0o12. 

	In parseInt() we can also pass an extra argument for telling which number system we are using.
	In .toString() if we pass the power of any number system it will convert it to that, for Ex -> num.toString(8)

	In today's time we don't use octal number system that much, but it is used for operation in Linux behind the scenes.

	It is also called Base8 Number system. (Cuz it has 8 digits to represent)

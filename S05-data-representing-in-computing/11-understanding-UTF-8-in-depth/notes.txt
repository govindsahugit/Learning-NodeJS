UTF-8 Encoding

	To see how data is converted and stored we can use some bash commands and extension.
	COMMANDS:
		xxd <filename> (give the UNICODE value)
		xxd -b <filename> (give the BINARY content)
		xxd -g 1 <filename> makes group of one byte
		
	HEX EDITOR Extension 	

	Encoding works on 2 different times. 
	1st when we save the file
	2ns when we open the file

	UTF-8 use variable byte system
	till 007F in Unicode (127 in ASCII) it uses 7 bits only to store it.
	
	UTF-8 Rules
		for 1 Bytes Character (0xxxxxxx) It can store 7 bits
		for 2 Bytes Character (110xxxxx 10xxxxxx) It can store 11 bits
		for 3 Bytes Character (1110xxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx) It can store 16 bits
		for 4 Bytes Character (11110xxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx) It can store 21 bits

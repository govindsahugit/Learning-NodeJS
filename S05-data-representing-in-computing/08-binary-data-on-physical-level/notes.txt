Binary Data on Physical Level

	How data is stored in our system in 0s and 1s
	Data representation is divided into:
		Data Storage and Data Transfer
	
	On physical level data is store in transistor using electron and protons.
	There are multiple transistor to hold it.
	The place where charge is we assume it as 1s and the place where charge is not we assume it as 0s
	Similarly in HDD we have magnetic plates, where southpole(0s) and northpole(1s)
	Full form of bits is BINARY DIGITS
	

	In Data transfer we use Electromagnetic waves (specially Radio waves)
	In  this 0s and 1s can be represent by high-low amplitudes OR Frequency, depends on condition.
	In wired connection, we use Fibre optic cables. In the cable lights is passed very fast. (Light means 1s, No light means 0s)
	In case of copper wire, we cannot pass light, we use electricity (High voltage 1s, Low Voltage 0s)
	
	How our System Stores Images, Videos, other medias ?
	Since on physical level our system only know how to store Binary digits via pules, magnetics poles, voltages, frequency, etc.
	So this binary digits are encrypted in this format that is can convert into other media form. The way of interpreting them is different

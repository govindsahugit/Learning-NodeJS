Character Set Vs Character Encoding
	
	In Character Set, each character is assigned a code to represent it.
	The most popular character set are:
		
	ASCII (American Standard code for Information Interchange) -> 128 Characters
		2^7 = 128 (It will be represented in 7 bits)	
	
	Unicode is capable of encoding 1.1 Million characters
	

	In Character Encoding, every set has it's own way of encoding.
	In case of ASCII, It's encoding is ASCII only. It uses 7 bits.
	In case of UTF-8, it uses 8 Bits

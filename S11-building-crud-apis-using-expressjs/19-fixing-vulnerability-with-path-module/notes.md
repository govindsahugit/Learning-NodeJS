## Path Manipulation Functions

These functions are designed for manipulating file paths.

- **`path.join()`**: Combines path segments into a single, normalized path.
  - Example: `path.join('/foo', 'bar', 'baz')` -> `/foo/bar/baz`
- **`path.normalize()`**: Normalizes a path by resolving relative segments (`..`, `.`) and redundant slashes.
  - Example: `path.normalize('/foo/bar//baz/../qux')` -> `/foo/bar/qux`
- **`path.resolve()`**: Resolves a sequence of paths into an absolute path.
  - Example: `path.resolve('foo', '/bar', 'baz')` -> `/bar/baz`
- **`path.basename()`**: Extracts the filename from a path.
  - Example: `path.basename('/foo/bar/baz.txt')` -> `baz.txt`
- **`path.dirname()`**: Extracts the directory part of a path.
  - Example: `path.dirname('/foo/bar/baz.txt')` -> `/foo/bar`

# Top-Level Navigation

## ⚡ What is it?

When a webpage is loaded directly in the main browser window/tab (the address bar URL).

Not inside an iframe, embedded element, or popup.

## ⚡ How does it work?

When you click a link or type a URL, the browser loads that site in the topmost browsing context (the tab).

Browser treats this as a full page navigation.

## ⚡ Why is it important?

- **Security:** Cookies with SameSite=Lax are only sent during top-level navigations, protecting against CSRF
- **Permissions:** APIs like camera/microphone often require top-level context
- **User Control:** Ensures the user is knowingly visiting the site (not hidden in an iframe)

## ⚡ Examples

✅ Visiting https://example.com directly in your browser → Top-level navigation

❌ example.com loaded inside an iframe on attacker.com → Not top-level navigation

✅ Clicking a Google search result that loads news.com in the tab → Top-level navigation

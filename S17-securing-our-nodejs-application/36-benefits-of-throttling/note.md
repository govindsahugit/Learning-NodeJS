# Benefits of Rate Limiting

## ⚡ Protects servers

Stops sudden floods of requests that can crash or slow down your system.

## ⚡ Prevents abuse

Blocks bots, scrapers, or attackers from spamming your API or login system.

## ⚡ Fair usage

Ensures one user doesn't hog all the resources, keeping it fair for everyone.

## ⚡ Better performance

Keeps traffic flow smooth and predictable, so your app runs faster.

## ⚡ Cost saving

Reduces extra load on servers, network, and database, saving infrastructure costs.

## ⚡ Improves security

Limits brute-force login attempts, DoS/DDoS effects, and other automated attacks.

## ⚡ User experience

By slowing down instead of blocking completely, real users don't feel punished.

## ⚡ Scalability

Makes it easier to handle sudden spikes in traffic (like during sales or events).

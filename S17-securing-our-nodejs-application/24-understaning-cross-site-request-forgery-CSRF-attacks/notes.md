# CSRF Attack (Cross-Site Request Forgery)

## ⚡ What it is?

CSRF is when a hacker tricks your browser into sending a request you didn't intend.

Since your browser has your cookies, the malicious request looks legit to the server.

## ⚡ How it works (Step by Step)

1. You log in to your bank (or any site) → Browser stores a session cookie
2. You visit a malicious site (attacker's blog, ad, or email link)
3. That site secretly makes a request to your bank
4. Browser automatically attaches your bank's cookies
5. Bank receives the request → sees valid cookie → assumes it's you → money transferred

## ⚡ Why it works?

Browsers auto-attach cookies to requests (same-site and cross-site).

The bank doesn't know if the request came from you or a hacker's site.

## ⚡ Real-World Examples

- Money transfer without permission 💰
- Changing your email/password on a site 🔑
- Submitting a malicious form on your behalf

## ⚡ How to Prevent CSRF

- **SameSite Cookies** → restrict cookie sending in cross-site requests
- **CSRF Tokens** → server generates a random token per session/request; form submissions must include it
- **Double Submit Cookie** → send CSRF token in both cookie + request body and compare
- **Check Referer/Origin Header** → validate the request came from the right site
- **Use Secure + HttpOnly Cookies**

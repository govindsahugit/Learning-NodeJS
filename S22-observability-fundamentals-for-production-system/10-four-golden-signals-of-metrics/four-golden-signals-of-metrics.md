## ⭐ Four Golden Signals of Metrics

In real systems, you can measure **hundreds of metrics** 📊  
But measuring everything creates noise, not clarity.

To solve this, engineers at **Google** introduced a focused model called the **Four Golden Signals**.

These signals are formally documented in the book: **Site Reliability Engineering**

The idea is simple 👇

> **If you understand these four signals, you understand the health of the system from a user’s perspective.**

## ⏱️ 1. Latency

### How long it takes to handle a request

Latency measures **response time**.

It answers:

* How fast does the system feel?
* Are users waiting too long?

Important detail 👇  
Latency is not just about averages.

Slow requests matter because:

* users feel the slowest responses
* one slow dependency can ruin the experience

A system can be “working” and still be unusable if latency is high.

## 📈 2. Traffic

### How much demand the system is handling

Traffic measures:

* number of incoming requests
* users or jobs being processed
* overall load on the system

Traffic provides **context**.

For example:

* high latency during high traffic may be expected
* high latency during low traffic is a red flag 🚩

Without traffic, other metrics lose meaning.

## ❌ 3. Errors

### How many requests are failing or behaving incorrectly

Errors measure:

* failed requests
* incorrect responses
* unexpected behavior

Errors are not only crashes.

They also include:

* partial failures
* wrong data
* degraded correctness

Even a small error rate can be serious at scale.

---

## 🔥 4. Saturation

### How close the system is to its limits

Saturation measures **resource pressure**.

Examples:

* CPU nearing full usage
* memory almost exhausted
* disk space is almost full

Saturation is especially important because:

* it predicts future failure
* systems often fail after staying saturated for some time

This signal tells you how much **headroom** is left.

## 🧠 Why These Four Signals Work Together

Each signal covers a different risk:

* ⏱️ Latency → user experience
* 📈 Traffic → demand and scale
* ❌ Errors → correctness and reliability
* 🔥 Saturation → capacity and future failure

Together, they answer:

* Is the system usable?
* Is it handling the load?
* Is it failing?
* Is it about to fail?

You don’t need dozens of metrics to start.
These four already give **strong visibility into system health**.

## 🎯 One Line to Remember

> **The Four Golden Signals provide a minimal, user-focused way to measure system health using latency, traffic, errors, and saturation.**

# Line Items

Line items are individual entries on invoices or receipts that break down charges, credits, or purchases. Each line describes a single product, service, fee, discount, tax, or adjustment with details that help buyers and sellers understand the total amount.

## Common Elements

- **Description**: Short name or explanation (e.g., "Widget A — 10-pack", "Consulting — 2 hours")
- **Quantity**: Number of units sold (e.g., 1, 3, 0.5)
- **Unit Price**: Price per unit (e.g., $12.00 each or $100/hour)
- **Line Total**: Quantity × unit price (before or after discounts)
- **SKU/Item Code** *(optional)*: Internal product identifier
- **Tax Code/Amount** *(optional)*: Applicable tax details
- **Discount** *(optional)*: Per-line promotions or reductions
- **Service Dates** *(optional)*: Duration or dates covered

## Why Line Items Matter

- **Transparency**: Shows exactly what the customer is billed for
- **Accounting**: Enables correct bookkeeping and revenue recognition
- **Tax Compliance**: Supports per-line item tax calculations
- **Inventory Management**: Updates stock levels using SKUs
- **Analysis**: Identifies best-selling products, margins, and trends

## Examples

**Retail Receipt:**
```
2 × T-shirt @ $15.00 = $30.00
1 × Socks @ $5.00 = $5.00
Subtotal: $35.00
Sales tax: $3.15
Total: $38.15
```

**Service Invoice:**
```
Consulting: 3 hours @ $120/hr = $360.00
Travel expense: 100 mi @ $0.58/mi = $58.00
Discount (10% loyalty): −$41.80
Total due: $376.20
```

## Best Practices

- Use concise, specific descriptions (include dates or project codes)
- Show quantity, unit price, and line totals separately
- Display taxes and discounts clearly
- Include item codes when relevant for customers or accounting teams

# 🧭 **Main Goal**

To know:

1. When a new subscription starts (first payment success) ✅
2. When recurring (auto) payments succeed 🔁
3. When payments fail ⚠️
4. When the subscription is canceled or ends 🚫
5. When Stripe retries or pauses/resumes 🕒

## 🧩 **Core Webhook Events to Listen For**

| Event                                           | When It Fires                                                                                                                           | What You Should Do                                                                                |

| **`customer.subscription.paused` / `.resumed`** | ⚠️ Stripe doesn’t send separate pause/resume events; they appear as `customer.subscription.updated` with changes in `pause_collection`. | - Detect pause/resume by comparing `pause_collection` (null ↔ object)                             |

## 🧠 **Minimal Recommended Set (for production apps)**

If you want to keep it simple but complete, handle these **five events**:

1. `checkout.session.completed` — first signup success
2. `invoice.payment_succeeded` — any successful charge (initial + renewals)
3. `invoice.payment_failed` — failed payment attempts
4. `customer.subscription.updated` — plan change, pause/resume, renewal
5. `customer.subscription.deleted` — cancellation

These five cover **the full lifecycle** of a subscription.

## 🧩 **Example Node.js Webhook Switch**

```js
switch (event.type) {
  case 'checkout.session.completed':
    const session = event.data.object;
    if (session.mode === 'subscription') {
      // Save session.customer & session.subscription
      // Grant initial access
    }
    break;

  case 'invoice.payment_succeeded':
    const invoice = event.data.object;
    // Extend access / mark renewal success
    break;

  case 'invoice.payment_failed':
    const failedInvoice = event.data.object;
    // Notify user / suspend access after retries
    break;

  case 'customer.subscription.updated':
    const sub = event.data.object;
    if (sub.pause_collection) {
      // handle pause
    } else if (sub.status === 'active') {
      // handle resume or plan change
    } else if (sub.status === 'past_due' || sub.status === 'unpaid') {
      // handle soft suspension
    }
    break;

  case 'customer.subscription.deleted':
    // Hard cancel — revoke access
    break;
}
```

## 🔁 **How Renewals Work Internally**

1. Stripe automatically generates a new **Invoice** before the next billing cycle (`invoice.upcoming`).
2. It tries to charge the card.
3. If it succeeds → `invoice.payment_succeeded` fires.
4. If it fails → `invoice.payment_failed` fires, Stripe retries later.
5. If retries fail → Subscription `status` becomes `past_due` → `unpaid` → eventually canceled (depends on your retry rules).

So for your app’s logic:

* **Extend access** only when you get `invoice.payment_succeeded`.
* **Revoke access** when you get `customer.subscription.deleted` or final failure.

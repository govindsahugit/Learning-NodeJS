# What are Orders in Razorpay?

## Flow
Backend calls Razorpay order API → Razorpay returns an order_id → send order_id to frontend → customer pays → Razorpay links the payment to that order

## What is an Order ID in Razorpay?
- An Order ID is a unique identifier (`order_xxxxxxx`) generated by Razorpay when you create an order
- It acts like a token or reference number for that specific payment request
- Example: If a customer wants to pay ₹1000, you create an order in Razorpay → it returns `order_Jh8u78uXk`

## When is an Order Created?
Orders are created before a payment happens. You call Razorpay's Orders API and specify:
- Amount
- Currency (INR/USD/other)
- Notes (optional info like "Invoice #123")
- Receipt ID (your internal tracking)

Razorpay then returns an order_id.

## Payment Modes Using Order ID
- Razorpay Checkout (Website/App Integration) → Mandatory
- Subscriptions → Each recurring charge tied to an order
- International Payments → Order required
- Invoices / Payment Links / Payment Pages → Razorpay creates order automatically

## Supported Payment Methods
- UPI
- Cards (credit/debit)
- Netbanking
- Wallets (Paytm, PhonePe, etc.)
- EMI / BNPL
- International cards

## Order Statuses
| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Created | Order created but no payment attempt yet |
| Attempted | At least one payment attempt made |
| Paid | Payment successful, order completed |

## Payment and Order Relationship
- Every Payment belongs to an Order → Payment ID (`pay_xxxxx`) attached to Order ID (`order_xxxxx`)
- One Order can have multiple Payments (multiple attempts) → Only one successful payment marks it as Paid
- Payments require an order (in most integrations)

**Invoice vs Receipt**

**Invoice:** A request for payment — sent before (or at) payment to ask the buyer to pay for goods or services.

**Receipt:** Proof of payment — issued after payment to confirm the buyer has paid.

| Aspect | Invoice | Receipt |
|--------|---------|---------|
| **Purpose** | Notifies buyer of amount due and payment terms | Confirms payment received |
| **Timing** | Before or at payment due date | After payment made |
| **Key Content** | Invoice number, dates, descriptions, amount due, payment terms | Receipt number, dates, items, amount paid, payment method |
| **Accounting Role** | Accounts receivable; tracks customer debt | Accounts payable; proves payment |
| **Tax Use** | Supports revenue and VAT/GST claims | Proves tax collected and paid |
| **Collection** | Used to request/enforce payment | Shows transaction complete |
| **Format** | Paper, PDF, e-invoicing with payment details | Till receipt, email, or PDF from POS |

**When to issue:**
- **Invoice:** When payment is expected later or formal billing needed (B2B, services)
- **Receipt:** After receiving payment (retail, post-settlement)

**Best practices:**
- Number sequentially for audit trails
- Include tax IDs on invoices where required
- Mark invoices "Paid" and reference receipt number
- Retain both for required tax authority periods

# Networking in Node.js

Node.js provides several core modules for network programming:

## Core Networking Modules
- **dgram**: For UDP/Datagram networking
- **net**: For TCP server/client implementations  
- **http**: For HTTP web servers and clients
- **https**: For HTTPS secure communication
- **dns**: For domain name resolution

Each module serves different networking needs:
- UDP for fast, connectionless communication
- TCP for reliable, connection-oriented data transfer
- HTTP/HTTPS for web services
- DNS for domain lookups

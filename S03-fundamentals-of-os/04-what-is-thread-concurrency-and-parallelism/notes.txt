Thread is worker of process.

Spawning a Process: Spawning a process is when a parent process starts or triggers a child process.

Thread ko ek process hi start karta hai and thread ko ek process hi use karta hai.

Concurrency: when you have 1 core CPU and your process have 3 threads each threads run in intence of time one by one, means when we have multiple threads in our process in achieved concurrency in our process.

Parallelism: When we have multiple core CPU and your process also have multiple threads each threads take different core in CPU and in same intence instead of one by one.

Here's a summary:

Core: A physical processing unit in a CPU that executes instructions. Modern CPUs have multiple cores for parallel processing.    

Thread: A sequence of instructions executed by the CPU, representing a logical flow of execution. Multiple threads can exist within a process and share its resources.    

Process: A running program with its own memory space and resources, isolated from other processes.    

Single-core vs. Multi-core: Single-core CPUs execute one task at a time, while multi-core CPUs enable parallel processing.    

Thread Creation & Execution: Software applications create threads, and the OS schedules and assigns them to CPU cores. A single-core CPU can switch between threads using time-sharing, giving the illusion of simultaneous execution.    

Hyper-threading: Improves efficiency but doesn't provide true parallel execution, which requires multiple physical cores.    

Thread Lifecycle: After execution, a thread moves to a terminated state, is cleaned up, removed from the scheduler, and its memory is freed.    

Zombie Threads: If threads aren't properly cleaned up, they can become zombie threads, consuming resources. Detached threads are automatically cleaned up by the OS.    

Concurrency: Multiple tasks making progress at the same time, but not necessarily simultaneously. The CPU switches between tasks rapidly.    

Parallelism: Tasks running at the same time, requiring multiple CPU cores or processors.

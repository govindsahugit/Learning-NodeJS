# Relational Vs Non-Relational DBs

## 1. Structure
- **Relational:** Stores data in tables (like Excel sheets – rows and columns)
- **Non-Relational:** Stores data in flexible formats like JSON, key-value pairs, or graphs

## 2. Schema
- **Relational:** Fixed structure – you must define the format before adding data
- **Non-Relational:** No fixed structure – you can store different types of data freely

## 3. Scalability
- **Relational:** Grows by getting a bigger machine (vertical scaling)
- **Non-Relational:** Grows by adding more machines (horizontal scaling), easier for big systems

## 4. ACID
- **Relational:** Follows strict rules to keep data accurate and safe (ACID)
- **Non-Relational:** May skip some rules for better speed and flexibility

## 5. Query Language
- **Relational:** Uses SQL – a standard language to ask and manage data
- **Non-Relational:** Uses different methods depending on the type (not always SQL)

## 6. Examples
- **Relational:** MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle
- **Non-Relational:** MongoDB (document), Redis (key-value), Cassandra (wide-column), Neo4j (graph)

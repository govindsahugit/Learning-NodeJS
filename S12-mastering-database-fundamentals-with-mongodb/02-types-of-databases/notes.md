# Relational vs Non-Relational Databases

## Relational Database (RDBMS)
- Stores data in tables, like Excel sheets.
- Data is organized in rows and columns.
- You must define the structure (schema) before adding data.
- Good at handling linked data (e.g., customers and their orders).
- Very accurate and reliable – used in banking, business apps.
- Needs powerful machines to scale.
- **Examples:** MySQL, PostgreSQL.

## Non-Relational Database (NoSQL)
- Stores data in a more flexible way – like JSON files, key-value pairs, or graphs.
- You don’t need to define a fixed structure before adding data.
- Good for fast-changing or large amounts of data.
- Easier to scale across many computers.
- Used in apps like social media, real-time chats, analytics.
- **Examples:** MongoDB, Redis, Cassandra.

## In Simple Terms
- Use **Relational DB** when your data is organized and linked (like school or bank data).
- Use **Non-Relational DB** when your data is messy, big, or changes often (like social media posts or logs).

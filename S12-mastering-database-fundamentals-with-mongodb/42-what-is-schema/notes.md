# Schema

A schema defines the structure of data in a database

It sets field names, data types, and rules (like required fields)

MongoDB is schema-less, but using schemas (e.g., with Mongoose) ensures data consistency and validation

Useful for catching errors, maintaining uniformity, and writing reliable queries

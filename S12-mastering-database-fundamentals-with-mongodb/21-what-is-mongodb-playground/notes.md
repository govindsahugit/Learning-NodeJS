## MongoDB Playground

MongoDB Playground is an interactive environment (mainly in VS Code) that lets you:

- Write and run MongoDB queries using JavaScript-like syntax.  
- Test database scripts like `insert`, `find`, `update`, etc.  
- Connect to real databases (local or remote).  
- Preview results inline in the editor.

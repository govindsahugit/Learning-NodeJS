### ACID = Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability

#### Atomicity
All steps in a transaction happen, or none happen.

**"All or nothing."**

#### Consistency
The database follows rules before and after the transaction.

**"Data stays valid."**

#### Isolation
Transactions don't interfere with each other.

**"No mix-ups when multiple users act at once."**

#### Durability
Once a transaction is saved, it stays saved â€” even after a crash.

**"It's permanent."**

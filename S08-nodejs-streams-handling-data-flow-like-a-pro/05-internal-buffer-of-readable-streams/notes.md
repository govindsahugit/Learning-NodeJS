Internal Buffer of Readable Stream

    The chunks that we recieve till the stream is ended is called as internal buffer.

    Every time this internal buffer changes with every chunk.
    Internal Buffer size is equivalent to highWaterMark.

    stream.on("readable", () => {
        console.log(stream.readableLength);
        console.log(stream.read());
        console.log(stream.readableLength);
    });

    Here we are listening for readable event, when it fires.
    It will show how much bytes of data is coming in chunk
    `strem.read()` will read the data.
    It will show remaining bytes of data in chunk.

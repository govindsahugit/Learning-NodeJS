Duplex, Transform, Pass Through Streams

    ğŸŸ¦ 1. Duplex Stream

    It can read and write data â€” both at the same time.
    Think of it like a walkie-talkie â€” you can send and receive messages.

    ğŸŸ© 2. Transform Stream

    It can read and write, but it also changes (transforms) the data in between.
    Think of it like a translator â€” you say something, it converts it, and then passes it on.

    ğŸŸ¨ 3. PassThrough Stream

    It also reads and writes, but it does not change the data.
    Think of it like a glass pipe â€” data just passes through it.

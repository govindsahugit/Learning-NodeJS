# Duplex, Transform, and PassThrough Streams

## ğŸŸ¦ Duplex Stream

- Can **read and write data simultaneously**.
- *Analogy*: Like a walkie-talkie â€” you can send and receive messages at the same time.

## ğŸŸ© Transform Stream

- Can **read and write**, but also **modifies (transforms) the data** as it passes through.
- *Analogy*: Like a translator â€” you say something, it converts it, and then passes it on.

## ğŸŸ¨ PassThrough Stream

- Can **read and write**, but **does not alter the data**.
- *Analogy*: Like a glass pipe â€” data just passes through unchanged.

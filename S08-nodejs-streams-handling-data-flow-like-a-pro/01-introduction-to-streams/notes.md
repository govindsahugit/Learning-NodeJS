## Introduction to Streams

A **stream** in Node.js is a method for processing data piece by piece, as it arrives, rather than loading everything into memory at once.

**Example:**  
Imagine transferring a very large file (e.g., 10 GiB) or the story of a zipline in a villageâ€”streams allow you to handle such data efficiently, chunk by chunk.

Data Streams (IMP)

    When a process start it has 3 types of dta streams.
    stdin -> mostly read the data.
    stdout -> mostly write the data.
    stderr -> mostly write the data.

    All are duplex streams.

    We get all this streams in process object.


    // ReadAble Stream
    process.stdin

    // Writable Stream
    process.stdout
    process.stderr

    console.log() behind the scenes use stdout stream.
    stderr is similar to stdout and is only used for showing the errors and warnings.

    File Descriptor(fd):
        stdin  -> 0
        stdout -> 1
        stderr -> 2
